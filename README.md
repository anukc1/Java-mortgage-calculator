# Java-mortgage-calculator
Using basic java's while loop and if else statement to create a mortgage calculator.
I'll be working in the terminal window and hence using this code for it:  Scanner(System.in), in line 10. 
I have created while loops to ask for a valid value for principle, interest and period and until the proper number is recieved, while loop will continue the user to enter a valid number and once it recieves it, it breaks out of the loop.
I used the if/else statement to verify the correct value within the while loop. 
I have used double as data type for the interest rate but float would be more appropriate since the number isn't going to be that big.
