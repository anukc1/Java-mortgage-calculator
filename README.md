# Java-mortgage-calculator
* Using basic java's while loop and if else statement to create a mortgage calculator.
* I'll be working in the terminal window and hence using this code for it:  Scanner(System.in), in line 10. 
* I have created while loops to ask for a valid value for principle, interest and period and until the proper number is recieved, while loop will continue the user to enter a valid number and once it recieves it, it breaks out of the loop.
* I used the if/else statement to verify the correct value within the while loop. 
* I have used double as data type for the interest rate but float would be more appropriate since the number isn't going to be that big. 

Following is the code used to create the calculator:
